# Autonomously-Solving-Rubiks-Cubes-using-Image-Analysis

Rubik’s cubes have gained popularity throughout the world and most people have
tried their hands at this seemingly simple, yet insanely difficult little puzzle. The
Rubik’s Cube is a 3-D mechanical puzzle which was invented in 1974 by Erno Rubik
as a toy. A classic Rubik’s Cube has 6 faces, each covered by nine stickers of one of
six colors, the standard set being: green, red, blue, orange, white, and yellow. The
cube has 12 degrees of freedom as each of the 6 faces can be rotated in 2 directions
each. After the cube is jumbled by a series of rotations, the cuber is expected to
solve it by bringing it back into its initial stage through a series of notations. In this
project, we attempt to make an autonomous Rubik’s cube solver that uses image
processing to detect the 3x3x3 cube, recognizes its present state, and uses Kociemba
algorithm to develop the optimal set of instructions required to solve the given cube.
